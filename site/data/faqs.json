    "question": "Do I need Spotify Premium to use Festify?",
    "answer": "Yes. Third party apps (like Festify) may only access Spotify's music catalogue through Spotify Premium accounts. This is a limitation from Spotify we have no influence over."
  }, {
    "question": "Which browsers do you support?",
    "answer": "Festify supports all so-called 'evergreen' browsers. That is, every common browser except for Internet Explorer. Our personal recommendations are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari. But any other browser that is based on one of them (like Opera, which is based on Google Chrome) works just as well. Playback is supported in Google Chrome and Firefox on desktop devices. Mobile Playback for Google Chrome is currently not possible due to a restriction from Spotify that will hopefully be lifted soon. If you are interested in background information, please visit https://github.com/spotify/web-playback-sdk/issues/10#issuecomment-358644985."
  }, {
    "question": "Why can't I create a Party in Safari?",
    "answer": "Due to a limitation from Spotify, we currently cannot play music in Safari-based browsers. When these restrictions are gone, we will update Festify to allow creating parties in Safari as well. If you are interested in background information, please visit https://github.com/spotify/web-playback-sdk/issues/10#issuecomment-358644985."
  }, {
    "question": "Does Festify support Spotify Connect?",
    "answer": "Right now, it doesn't. However, Spotify has recently opened up their connect system to third party developers like us. This means that when the new version is stable and running well, we'll focus our efforts to supporting full Spotify connect playback."
  }, {
    "question": "What about Sonos?",
    "answer": "As we are very active Sonos users ourselves, we'd surely like to have that kind of functionality! However, Sonos does not have an open API we could hook into. While we will do our best, we cannot guarantee that we will get something that works to our satisfaction."
