As we are very active Sonos users ourselves, Sonos support is very high on our list! We will start working on it as soon as version 3 works reliably.

Sonos integration can be a little tricky though. While we will do our best, we cannot guarantee that we will get something that works to our satisfaction. Please don't be mad at us. 😝
