If you're experiencing bugs or have ideas for new features, you can create an issue on
our [GitHub project](https://github.com/Festify/app/issues/new), use our
[feedback form](/feedback) or tweet us [@GetFestify](https://twitter.com/GetFestify).

We're trying to answer each request as quickly as possible.
