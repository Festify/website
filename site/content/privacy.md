Google Analytics using Google's own [browser plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

[Google's help page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).

Our website is hosted on Netlify. You can check their [privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) for more information.
